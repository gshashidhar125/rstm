   *  is not easy to define, though, because a thread may call this with a
   *  non-null scope, which is our "in transaction" flag.  In practice, such
   *  a thread is calling install_algorithm from the end of either its abort
   *  or commit code, so it is 'not in a transaction'
   *
   *  Another, and more important invariant, is that the caller must have
   *  personally installed begin_blocker.  There are three reasons to install
   *  begin_blocker: irrevocability, thread creation, and mode switching.
   *  Each of those actions, independently, can only be done by one thread at
   *  a time.  Furthermore, no two of those actions can be done
   *  simultaneously.
