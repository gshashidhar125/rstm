#summary Description of how to build RSTM

= Introduction =

This page is a stub.  It will eventually have instructions on how to configure and build RSTM.  There are two main targets:

  * Library API: This target is suitable for SPARC, and for x86 on platforms that do not have the Intel transactional C++ compiler

  * CXXTM API: This target is suitable for x86 platforms that have the Intel transactional C++ compiler

== Stub Notes ==

We should describe every build option, what it means, and how to use it.
