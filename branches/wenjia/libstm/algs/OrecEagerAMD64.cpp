/**
 *  OrecEager Implementation:
 *
 *    This STM is similar to LSA/TinySTM and to the algorithm published by
 *    Wang et al. at CGO 2007.  The algorithm uses a table of orecs, direct
 *    update, encounter time locking, and undo logs.
 *
 *    The principal difference is in how OrecEager handles the modification
 *    of orecs when a transaction aborts.  In Wang's algorithm, a thread at
 *    commit time will first validate, then increment the counter.  This
 *    allows for threads to skip prevalidation of orecs in their read
 *    functions... however, it necessitates good CM, because on abort, a
 *    transaction must run its undo log, then get a new timestamp, and then
 *    release all orecs at that new time.  In essence, the aborted
 *    transaction does "silent stores", and these stores can cause other
 *    transactions to abort.
 *
 *    In LSA/TinySTM, each orec includes an "incarnation number" in the low
 *    bits.  When a transaction aborts, it runs its undo log, then it
 *    releases all locks and bumps the incarnation number.  If this results
 *    in incarnation number wraparound, then the abort function must
 *    increment the timestamp in the orec being released.  If this timestamp
 *    is larger than the current max timestamp, the aborting transaction must
 *    also bump the timestamp.  This approach has a lot of corner cases, but
 *    it allows for the abort-on-conflict contention manager.
 *
 *    In our code, we skip the incarnation numbers, and simply say that when
 *    releasing locks after undo, we increment each, and we keep track of the
 *    max value written.  If the value is greater than the timestamp, then at
 *    the end of the abort code, we increment the timestamp.  A few simple
 *    invariants about time ensure correctness.
