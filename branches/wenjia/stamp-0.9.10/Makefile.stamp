# In order to avoid creating config files, we use the following approach:
# when we make, we give the name of a platform being targeted.  If that
# platform exists, then there's a file in $(MKFOLDER) with the platform as
# its basename and .mk as its suffix.  If we re-invoke make including that
# platform as an additional makefile (to this one), then we'll have all the
# definitions we need to build the right way.
