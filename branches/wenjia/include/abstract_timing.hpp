/**
 *  This file provides an abstract interface to scheduling and timing
 *  functions.  It used to be more complex, but now that we do not have Win32
 *  support, everything is POSIX, and it's a little bit easier.  Note that we
 *  keep the abstractions, though, so that we can be sure that if we re-add
 *  Win32 support, it will be easy.
 *
 *  The key functions defined in this file are:
 *    sleep_ms()       - sleep for a number of milliseconds
 *    yield_cpu()      - offer to yield the CPU
 *    getElapsedTime() - access some sort of hi-res timer
