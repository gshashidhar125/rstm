   *  anything with an address between %esp at the start of the outermost
   *  transaction, and %esp at the time that the filter function is called.
   *
   *  This is used by NOrec in its read barrier, where it can't afford to log
   *  reads to the stack for fear of self-aborts due to aliasing.
   *
   *  We get the top of the stack at the start of the transaction from the
   *  checkpoint that we made at _ITM_beginTransaction. This is done in a
   *  platform dependent manner, and is implemented in checkpoint.hpp.
   *
   *  We get the top of the stack *now* by taking the address of the txtop
   *  variable that we allocated in this frame.
   *
   *    if (txtop - addr > txtop - addr) return true;
   *    else return false;
   *
   *  NB: we're assuming that a T lives either inside the tx stack region, or
   *      outside, but that its consistuent bytes don't overlap the stack
   *      region.
   *
   *  NB: We also rely on unsigned integer underflow creating a large positive
   *      number.
   *
   *  NB: This should be safe to inline because txtop should be in the stack
   *      frame of the caller once it's inlined. [ld] can we guarantee that it
   *      isn't reordered within the same frame?
