/**
 *  This file presents a simple library API for using RSTM without compiler
 *  support.  The API consists of the following:
 *
 *  TM_ALLOC            : Allocate memory inside a transaction
 *  TM_FREE             : Deallocate memory inside a transaction
 *  TM_SYS_INIT         : Initialize the STM library
 *  TM_SYS_SHUTDOWN     : Shut down the STM library
 *  TM_THREAD_INIT      : Initialize a thread before using TM
 *  TM_THREAD_SHUTDOWN  : Shut down a thread
 *  TM_SET_POLICY(P)    : Change the STM algorithm on the fly
 *  TM_BECOME_IRREVOC() : Become irrevocable or abort
 *  TM_READ(var)        : Read from shared memory from a txn
 *  TM_WRITE(var, val)  : Write to shared memory from a txn
 *  TM_BEGIN(type)      : Start a transaction... use 'atomic' as type
 *  TM_END              : End a transaction
 *
 *  Custom Features:
 *
 *  stm::restart()                : Self-abort and immediately retry a txn
 *  TM_BEGIN_FAST_INITIALIZATION  : For fast initialization
 *  TM_END_FAST_INITIALIZATION    : For fast initialization
 *  TM_GET_ALGNAME()              : Get the current algorithm name
 *
 *  Compiler Compatibility::Annotations (unused in library):
 *
 *  TM_WAIVER        : mark a block that does not get TM instrumentation
 *  TM_CALLABLE      : mark a function as being callable by TM

/**
 * This is gross.  ITM, like any good compiler, will make nontransactional
 * versions of code so that we can cleanly do initialization from outside of
 * a transaction.  The library **can** do this, but only via some cumbersome
 * template games that we really don't want to keep playing (see the previous
 * release for examples).
 *
 * Since we don't want to have transactional configuration (it is slow, and
 * it messes up some accounting of commits and transaction sizes), we use the
 * following trick: if we aren't using a compiler for instrumentation, then
 * BEGIN_FAST_INITIALIZATION will copy the current STM configuration (envar
 * STM_CONFIG) to a local, then switch the mode to CGL, then call the
 * instrumented functions using CGL instrumentation (e.g., the lightest
 * possible, and correct without a 'commit').  Likewise, if we aren't using a
 * compiler for instrumentation, then END_FAST_INITIALIZATION will restore
 * the original configuration, so that the app will use the STM as expected.
