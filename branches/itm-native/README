RSTM Release 8 Notes

The latest RSTM release features the following changes:

- Native Support for the Intel Transactional C++ Compiler

Important Build Notes

- The svn development branch must be autoreconf-ed before being configured,
  because we haven't checking in the autoconf=automake products. Run the
  'autogen' script from the root. This will generate the configure script.
