/**
 *  CohortsFilter Implementation
 *
 *  Cohorts using BitFilter for validations
 *
 * [mfs] We should have another version of this with TINY filters (eg 64 bits).
 *
 * [mfs] I am worried about the WBRs in this code.  It would seem that CFENCE
 *       would suffice.  The problem could relate to the use of SSE.  It would
 *       be good to verify that the WBRs can't be replaced with CFENCEs when
 *       SSE is turned off.  It would also be good to implement with 64-bit
 *       filters, which wouldn't use SSE, to see if that eliminated the need
 *       for WBR to get proper behavior.  It's possible that the WBR is just
 *       enforcing WAW behavior between SSE registers and non-SSE registers.
