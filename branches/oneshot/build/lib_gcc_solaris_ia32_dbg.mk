# NB: corei7 may not be available on older versions of gcc.  This makefile
# assumes a 4.7-ish gcc.  Please adjust accordingly.

# Warning: This won't work without also including Rules.mk, but to avoid
# weird path issues, we include it from the invocation, not from this file.

# [mfs] TODO - we should build each benchmark 3 times, with known suffixes,
#              and then just link to create executables.  This isn't an issue
#              yet, since we only have norec and cgl, but it will be an issue
#              eventually
#
#              We also need proper dependencies
