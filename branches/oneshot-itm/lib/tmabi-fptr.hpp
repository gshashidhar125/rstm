   *  All behaviors are reachable via function pointers.  This allows us to
   *  change on the fly. These are public because there is an api file
   *  (stmapi_fptr) that wants to call them directly. If stmapi_fptr ever goes
   *  away, we can drop this into a private namespace.
   *
   *  [ld] It would be nice to use the types defined in adaptivity.hpp for
   *       this, but we don't want to expose the autobuilt tmnames header. If
   *       we switch to constructor-based initialization we could use
   *       adaptivity.hpp.
   *
   *  [ld] We only have function pointers that are relevant to the stmapi_fptr
   *       header, i.e., there are more per-algorithm behaviors, but they're
   *       not relevent for this API.
