/**
 *  OrecELA Implementation
 *
 *    This is similar to the Detlefs algorithm for privatization-safe STM,
 *    TL2-IP, and [Marathe et al. ICPP 2008].  We use commit time ordering to
 *    ensure that there are no delayed cleanup problems, we poll the timestamp
 *    variable to address doomed transactions, but unlike the above works, we
 *    use TinySTM-style extendable timestamps instead of TL2-style timestamps,
 *    which sacrifices some publication safety.
