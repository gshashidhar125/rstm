/**
 *  This is a good-faith implementation of SwissTM.
 *
 *  What that means, precisely, has to do with how we translate the SwissTM
 *  algorithm to allow /algorithmic/ comparisons with OrecEager and LLT.
 *  Specifically, we decided in the past that OrecEager and LLT would not use
 *  any of the clever 'lock is a pointer into my writeset' tricks that were
 *  proposed in the TinySTM paper, and so we don't use those tricks here,
 *  either.  The cost is minimal (actually, with the RSTM WriteSet hash, the
 *  tricks are typically not profitable anyway), but it is worth stating, up
 *  front, that we do not adhere to this design point.
 *
 *  Additionally, orec management differs slightly here from in OrecEager and
 *  LLT.  In those systems, we use "2-word" orecs, where the acquirer writes
 *  the old orec value in the second word after acquiring the first word.
 *  This halves the cost of logging, as the list of held locks only gives
 *  orec addresses, not the old values.  However, in SwissTM, there is a
 *  tradeoff where on one hand, having rlocks separate from wlocks can
 *  decrease cache misses for read-only transactions, but on the other hand
 *  doing so doubles logging overhead for read locking by writers at commit
 *  time.  It would be odd to use the 2-word orecs for read locks and not for
 *  write locks, but a more efficient technique is to use the second word of
 *  2-word orecs as the rlock, and then use traditional 2-word lock logging,
 *  where the old lock value is also stored.
 *
 *  Other changes are typically small.  The biggest deals with adding
 *  detection of remote aborts, which wasn't discussed in the paper.
 *
 *  NB: we could factor some CM code out of the RO codepath.  We could also
 *  make the phase2 switch cause a thread to use different function pointers.
