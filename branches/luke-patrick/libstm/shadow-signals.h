/// The mechanics of shadowing a handler are simple. The "shadowing handler"
/// looks lik a standard sigaction, but it gets the shadowed handler as an
/// additional parameter (actually, it gets some continuation as a parameter,
/// which it can think of as a shadowed handler).
///
/// The shadowing handler has three choices.
///
///   1) It can ignore the continuation and just return to the caller, which
///      effectively terminates the signal handling process. An example of this
///      would be the timer handler that demultiplexes a timer and finds that
///      it's directed towards libstm. In this case, the user handler should
///      never be called.
///
///   2) It can simply call the continuation after its done whatever it needs
///      to do.
///
///   3) It can return via lonjmp or siglongjmp to some previous point in the
///      code.
///
/// The library intercepts the signal and sigaction calls, so the shadowing
/// system only needs to indicate that it's installing handlers (like libjsig)
/// and the library can deal with it.
