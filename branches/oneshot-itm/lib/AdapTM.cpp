   *  Template Metaprogramming trick for initializing all STM algorithms.
   *
   *  This is either a very gross trick, or a very cool one.  We have ALG_MAX
   *  algorithms, and they all need to be initialized.  Each has a unique
   *  identifying integer, and each is initialized by calling an instantiation
   *  of initTM<> with that integer.
   *
   *  Rather than call each function through a line of code, we use a
   *  tail-recursive template: When we call MetaInitializer<0>.init(), it will
   *  recursively call itself for every X, where 0 <= X < ALG_MAX.  Since
   *  MetaInitializer<X>::init() calls initTM<X> before recursing, this
   *  instantiates and calls the appropriate initTM function.  Thus we
   *  correctly call all initialization functions.
   *
   *  Furthermore, since the code is tail-recursive, at -O3 g++ will inline all
   *  the initTM calls right into the sys_init function.  While the code is not
   *  performance critical, it's still nice to avoid the overhead.
